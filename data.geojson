children facing a potentially life-threatening condition. When a child
is diagnosed with a potentially life-threatening illness, the
Compassion Net team will work closely with hospital staff and primary
care providers to help support the child, siblings and family through
diagnosis, treatment, stabilization, cure, or at times, end of life
and bereavement. Each family is assigned a Case Manager and has access
to the Pediatric Palliative Care Medical Team and Child Life
Specialists. <br> Eligibility: To be eligible, a child must a) be
diagnosed with a condition that places the child at significant risk
for not reaching adulthood (age 21), OR b) have acute exacerbation of

currently enrolled in a health insurance program managed by Excellus
